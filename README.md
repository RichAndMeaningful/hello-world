# hello-world
The purpose of this hello-world repository is to learn how to use GitHub
I'm a learning how to use GitHub because it seems to be the standard method of contributing to open source projects. 
I am interested in contributing to Pokemon Showdown
I will keep track of the work that I do on this project, and show it to a future employer when I start looking for jobs as a developer.
